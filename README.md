# Dashboard

## Introduction

Basically I'm creating a dashboard that shows:
- Current time
- Computer status which includes:
  - Current keyboard input language (triggered by keyboard maestro)
  - Current workspace
  - Current connected USB devices
- Now playing panel that interfaces with PLEX to show current playing music
- List of tasks pulled from my Habitify account
- Grammar cheatsheets for foreign languages

You will also see any lint errors in the console.
